# node-xiaomi-mitv2-remote
Node.js module to get control a Xiaomi MiTV2 over the network. Should also work with other MiTV's.

# IMPORTANT
Pleae note that I am no longer maintaining this project as I do not have a Xiaomi TV. If somebody wants to donate me a TV, I will happily continue development, but failing that I cannot do any additional work.

I created this using "Charles" MITM proxy and just seeing what kind of traffic is sent between iOS app and the TV.

Pleae have a look at some of the forks, I think other people are actively developing. I will happily consider any pull requests.
